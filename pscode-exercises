// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

//Psuedocode for exercise 1
Start
Initialize and declare variables for 2 numbers
Use Sum function to add 2 numbers
Print results of the 2 numbers
END

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

//Psedocode for exercise 2
Start
Declare a number variable
Prompt user for number input and pull into variable
Use funtions or division to determine if number is even or Odd
Print output to the screen to show if number is even or Odd
END


// Exercise 3: Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
// a.) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
// b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
// c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
// d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

//Pseudocode for Exercise 3
Start
Prompt user to enter 5 numbers (with details on how they should enter them - comma separated, enter after each, etc.)
Use a loop or an array to read in the variables
Calcualte average of numbers by either using the sum function to add up all of the entered number and divide the result by 5 to get the average or running the average function on the array
Find the smallest number using a loop
    Declare a number variable
    Set a variable equal to the first number
    Compare the first and second number and set the lowest to the variable
    Continue until all numbers are compared
Find the largest number using a loop
    Declare a number variable
    Set a variable equal to the first number
    Compare the first and second number and set the higher to the variable
    Continue until all numbers are compared
Output the smallest, largest and average numbers using the print function and some explanatory text

//See below for my attempts at the next phase of completing the exercise. Saving in case we need to come back to this.

//Attempted coding for exercise 1 
//Start
//num1=x
//num2=y
//sum=(num1,num2)
//print(sum)
//End

// Next steps to begin coding exercise 2
// Start
//declare number variable
// prompt user for input of variable
//print ("Enter any number")
//divide input number by 2
// if number is evenly divisable by 2 (Google says "mod" is the function for this)
//    print ("The number is Even")
//else
//    print ("The number is Odd")
//End

// Next steps to begin coding exercise 3 - as much as time would allow
// a.) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
//Start
//print ("Please enter 5 numbers one at a time, pressing enter after each one:")
// Use loop to read in 5 numbers and increase ReadCount variable with each read to change the name of the variable storing the new number
//ReadCount=1
//While ReadCount <= 5 
//    varible + ReadCount = input
//    ReadCount = ReadCount + 1
//END

// b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
//Start
// Use sum function in Python to add up all of the numbers
//OverallSum=sum(variabe1,variable2,variabe3,variabe4,variabe5)
// Use OverallAverage to divide OverallSum by 5
//OverallAverage=OverallSum/5
//End

// c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
//Start
//Declare variables Largest and Smallest
//Use min function to find smallest number, assign value to variable Smallest
//Use max function to find largest number, assign value to variable Largest
//END 
// *** Longer method I wrote first before I Googled min and max functions  :) **
// Start
//Largest loop
// Largest = num1
// Loop through all 5 numbers
// Use if statements to compare num1 and num2, assign whichever number is larger to Largest variable and complete loop to have largest number
//Smallest loop
// Smallest=num1
// Loop through all 5 numbers
// Use if statements to compare num1 and num2, assign whichever number is smaller to Smallest variable and complete loop to have smallest number
// End

// d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
//Start 
//print("Thank you for entering numbers today! Here are some facts about your numbers:")
//print("The average of the 5 numbers you entered is " OverallAverage)
//print("The Smallest Number you entered is " Smallest)
//print("The Largest Number you entered is " Largest)
//END
