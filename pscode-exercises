// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Start
num1=x
num2=y
sum=(num1,num2)
print(sum)
End

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Start
declare number variable
// prompt user for input of variable
print ("Enter any number")
divide input number by 2
// if number is evenly divisable by 2 (Google says "mod" is the function for this)
    print ("The number is Even")
else
    print ("The number is Odd")
End

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

// a.) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
Start
print ("Please enter 5 numbers one at a time, pressing enter after each one:")
// Use loop to read in 5 numbers and increase ReadCount variable with each read to change the name of the variable storing the new number
ReadCount=1
While ReadCount <= 5 
    varible + ReadCount = input
    ReadCount = ReadCount + 1
END

// b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
Start
// Use sum function in Python to add up all of the numbers
OverallSum=sum(variabe1,variable2,variabe3,variabe4,variabe5)
// Use OverallAverage to divide OverallSum by 5
OverallAverage=OverallSum/5
End

// c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
Start
Declare variables Largest and Smallest
Use min function to find smallest number, assign value to variable Smallest
Use max function to find largest number, assign value to variable Largest
END 

// *** Longer method I wrote first before I Googled min and max functions  :) **
// Start
//Largest loop
// Largest = num1
// Loop through all 5 numbers
// Use if statements to compare num1 and num2, assign whichever number is larger to Largest variable and complete loop to have largest number
//Smallest loop
// Smallest=num1
// Loop through all 5 numbers
// Use if statements to compare num1 and num2, assign whichever number is smaller to Smallest variable and complete loop to have smallest number
// End

// d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
Start 
print("Thank you for entering numbers today! Here are some facts about your numbers:")
print("The average of the 5 numbers you entered is " OverallAverage)
print("The Smallest Number you entered is " Smallest)
print("The Largest Number you entered is " Largest)
END
